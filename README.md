This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript's error handling.  The `bug.vbs` file contains a function with a flawed error-handling mechanism. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version. The primary issue is the potential for unexpected behavior when using `Err.Raise` without proper context management or a robust error checking approach. This issue often shows up when dealing with null or empty parameters.
